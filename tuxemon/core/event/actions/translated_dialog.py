class TranslatedDialogAction(EventAction):
    """ Opens a dialog window with translated text according to the passed translation key. Parameters
    passed to the translation string will also be checked if a translation key exists.

    Valid Parameters: dialog_key,[var1=value1,var2=value2]

    You may also use special variables in dialog events. Here is a list of available variables:

    * ${{name}} - The current player's name.

    Parameters following the translation name may represent one of two things:
    If a parameter is var1=value1, it represents a value replacement.
    If it's a single value (an integer or a string), it will be used as an avatar image.
    TODO: This is a hack and should be fixed later on, ideally without overloading the parameters.

    **Examples:**

    >>> action.__dict__
    {
        "type": "translated_dialog",
        "parameters": [
            "received_x",
