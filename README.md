Installation
------------

If you want to try the game, it's recommended to download and try the
development branch first. The master branch should be stable, but is
often out of date.


### Windows Source

Requires Python 3.8+ and git.

Install the latest version of Python 3 from
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and the latest version of Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon.git
cd Tuxemon
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
python3 run_tuxemon.py
```

### Windows Binary

Check the [release page](https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon/releases)
for binaries.


### Flatpak

Check the [web page](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.tuxemon.Tuxemon) for a complete explanation

Before install check the flatpak [requires](https://www.flatpak.org/setup/)

```shell
flatpak install flathub org.tuxemon.Tuxemon
flatpak run org.tuxemon.Tuxemon
```

### Debian/Ubuntu with virtual environment

This is the recommended way to run because it will not modify the
system.
```shell
sudo apt install git python3-venv
git clone https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon.git
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd Tuxemon
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
python3 run_tuxemon.py
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

*Not recommended* because it will change system-installed packages
```shell
sudo apt install python3 python3-pygame python3-pip python3-imaging git
git clone https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon.git
cd Tuxemon
sudo pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
python3 run_tuxemon.py
```

*Debian/Ubuntu optional rumble support*

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential
git clone https://github.com/zear/libShake.git
cd libShake/
make BACKEND=LINUX; sudo make install BACKEND=LINUX
```

### Fedora Linux

```shell
sudo dnf install SDL*-devel freetype-devel libjpeg-devel portmidi-devel python3-devel virtualenv venv
git clone https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon.git
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd Tuxemon
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
python3 run_tuxemon.py
```

### Arch Linux

An [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tuxemon-git/) is availible however manual installation is reccomended.

```shell
sudo pacman -S python python-pip python-pillow python-pygame python-pydantic git
git clone https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon.git
cd Tuxemon
python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
python run_tuxemon.py
```


### Smartphones

Android builds are highly experimental. You will have to build Tuxemon yourself
using the script located in the buildconfig folder.
After this you will need to manually install the mods folder via the following instructions.
Connect your device to your computer and make a folder called
"Tuxemon" in "Internal Storage", then copy the mods folder.  Tuxemon
will also need file system permissions, which you can set in your phones
settings.

Caveat Emptor

### Mac OS X (Yosemite)

```shell
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew tap Homebrew/python
brew update
brew install python
brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf portmidi git
brew install sdl_mixer --with-libvorbis
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/pygame/pygame.git
sudo pip install -U -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon.git
ulimit -n 10000; python run_tuxemon.py
```

Controls
--------

##### Game Controls
###### You can also set inputs in the options menu or config file
* *Arrow Keys* - Movement
* *Enter* - Select/activate
* *ESC* - Menu/Cancel
* *Shift* - Sprint

##### Debugging

You can enable dev_tools by changing `dev_tools` to `True` in the
`tuxemon.cfg` file:

```
[game]
dev_tools = True
```

These keyboard shortcuts are available with dev tools enabled
* *r* - Reload the map tiles
* *n* - No clip

##### Map Editor

Use *Tiled* map editor: https://www.mapeditor.org/


CLI Interface
--------------

The CLI interface is a very convenient way to debug and develop your
maps. After you enable the CLI interface, you can use the terminal to
enter commands.  You could, for example, give your self potions to
battle, or add a monster directly to your party.  It's also possible to
change game variables directly.  In fact, any action or condition that
is usable in the map can be used with the CLI interface.

### Setting up

You can enable cli by changing `cli_enabled` to `True` in the
`tuxemon.cfg` file:

```
[game]
cli_enabled = True
```

### Commands

- `help [command_name]` — Lists all commands, or specific information on a command.
- `action <action_name> [params]` — Execute EventAction.  Uses same syntax as the map script.
- `test <condition_name> [params]` — Test EventCondition.  Uses same systax as the map script.
- `random_encounter` — Sets you in a wild tuxemon battle, similar to walking in tall grass.
- `trainer_battle <npc_slug>` — Sets you in a trainer battle with specified npc.
- `quit` — Quits the game.
- `whereami` — Prints out the map filename
- `shell` — Starts the Python shell, that you can use to modify the game directly. For advanced users.

### CLI Examples

Get Commands

```
> help
Available Options
=================
action  help  quit  random_encounter  shell  test  trainer_battle  whereami

Enter 'help [command]' for more info.
```

Get help on an action

```
> help action teleport

    Teleport the player to a particular map and tile coordinates.

    Script usage:
        .. code-block::

            teleport <map_name>,<x>,<y>

    Script parameters:
        map_name: Name of the map to teleport to.
        x: X coordinate of the map to teleport to.
        y: Y coordinate of the map to teleport to.
```

Test and give an item
```
> test has_item player,potion
False
> action add_item potion,1
> test has_item player,potion
True
```

**NOTE!**  The CLI interface is new and the error messages are not very
helpful. In general, you should be using the commands when the game is
playing, and you are on the world map.


Check out the
[scripting reference](https://tuxemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handcrafted/scripting.html) 
for all the available actions and conditions for use with `action` and `test`!


Building
--------

There are many scripts for various builds in the buildconfig folder. 
These are meant to be run from the project root directory, for example,
to build the portable pypy build:

```shell
[user@localhost Tuxemon]$ buildconfig/build_pypy_portable_linux.sh
```

There will be a new directory called build, which will have the package
if everything was successful.

WARNING!  The build scripts are designed to be run in a dedicated VM.
They will add and remove packages and could leave your OS in a bad
state.  You should not use them on your personal computer.  Use in a vm
or container.
