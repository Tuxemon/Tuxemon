Contributing
============

By committing or contributing data/files to the Tuxemon project, or any sub-
projects (the "Projects"), you agree to license your code under the GNU General
Public License version 3 and any later version (the "License").
In particular, you guarantee that you have acquired all necessary legal rights
from possible other copyright holders to license the contributions.

In any case, any contributions to the Projects must be able to be
re-distributed by the maintainers or others as part of the Git repository and
cloned repositories, in compiled binaries, and any other ways permitted by the
License.

## What code can I contribute?
Any of the issues on the [Tuxemon issue list](https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon/issues)
are things we are looking to have implemented in Tuxemon. Feel free to fork the project
and taking a shot at anything on the list! If you have a suggestion for a feature
that's not on the current issues list, post a topic on the Programming section of the
[Tuxemon Forums](https://forum.tuxemon.org/index.php) and discuss ways we might implement
it in the game.

## How do I contribute code?
Tuxemon uses the ["Fork & Pull"](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#fork--pull)
method for code contributions. The *fork & pull* model lets anyone fork an existing
repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be
granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source
repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new
contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work
independently without upfront coordination.

## Making a Pull Request
**When you're ready to make a pull request, submit your pull to the "development" branch.**
The "master" branch is used for releases.
