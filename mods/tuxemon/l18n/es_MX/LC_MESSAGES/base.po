"You are unusual. You are not approved by Omnichannel. You might be the trainer we have been waiting for.\n"
"Omnichannel, as ruthless as they are, are not the only threat we have here. There is another organization called Spyder.\n"
"You shouldn't have to worry too much about them. They aren't too active around here.\n"
"Now, we'll send you back on your journey. Only if you agree to help us against Omnichannel.\n"
"Otherwise, we will report you to Omnichannel ourselves. And you will lose everything. We are always watching.\n"

"Allie: Yes, this is the Omnichannel, I'm just a lowly guard though. Who are you?\n"
"{name}...\n"
"Hmm. A strong name. My house is not too far, maybe... after work... you could show me your strength?\n"

"Oh! Where are my manners. My name is Ae... You know what? I'll just write it.\n"
"Aeble\n"
"It's pronounced ahbluh, but everyone just calls me Able. You can call me that, I guess...\n"
"Aeble: I'm the CEO here at the omnichannel, every broadcast you see, gets approved by me.\n"
"Now, I'm not the only one that does their part, we have a board that helps us administrate the districts\n"
"The board has been reelected since it was formed. They've done a great job though, so it makes sense.\n"
"Omnichannel's goal is to open up the world to all. The only way to do that though, to make everyone equal,\n"
"Was to restrict Tuxemon.\n"
"We started with confiscation, but most Tuxemon managed to escape. So we went to extreme measures.\n"
"Our sister organization Spyder developed a drug that could change Tuxemon.\n"
"It isolated a portion of the brain that every Tuxemon mysteriously has and overloaded it.\n"
"Once the Gage Paludal Lamina was overloaded with electricity, their will to resist faded and they became docile.\n"
"Because of this, a few species are dead, Rockitten, Fruitera, and Hydrone specifically.\n"
"This doesn't matter now though. This generation now doesn't even know what Tuxemon are unless they work for us.\n"
"The birthrate is at an all time high, and approval of the Omnichannel has not fallen since the year before the restriction\n"
"Tuxemon are a perversive curse that destroys humanity. Omnichannel has fixed that and imposed order.\n"
"Tuxemon destroy and anyone who says otherwise is lying. Sorry, I must head to work.\n"
