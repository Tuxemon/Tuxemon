"""
This module is for handling breaking changes to the save file.

Renaming maps:
  - Increment the value of SAVE_VERSION (e.g. from 1 to 2)
  - Add an entry to MAP_RENAMES consisting of:
    - The previous value of SAVE_VERSION (e.g. 1) mapping to
    - A 'dictionary' made up of pairs of:
        - The name of each map that has been renamed (the key)
        - The new name of the map (the value)
    Keys and values are separated by colons, each key-value pair is separated by a comma
    e.g.
        MAP_RENAMES = {
            # 1: {'before1.tmx': 'after1.tmx', 'before2.tmx': 'after2.tmx'},
        }

Other changes:
(If you have changed the codebase in such a way that older save files cannot be loaded)
    - Increment the value of SAVE_VERSION
    - Amend the `upgrade_save` function as necessary
