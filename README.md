* *python-pytmx* - python library to read Tiled Map Editor's TMX maps.
* *python-pyscroll* - fast module for animated scrolling maps.

*Optional*

* *libShake* - rumble library for Linux.

* *Enter* - Select/activate
* *ESC* - Menu/Cancel
* *Shift* - Sprint

##### Map Editor

Use *Tiled* map editor: http://www.mapeditor.org/


Building
--------

There are many scripts for various builds in the buildconfig folder.  These
are meant to be run from the project root directory, for example, to build
the portable pypy build:
```
[user@localhost Tuxemon]$ buildconfig/build_pypy_portable_linux.sh
```
There will be a new directory called build, which will have the package if
everything was successful.

WARNING!  The build scripts are designed to be run in a VM.  They will
add and remove packages and could leave you OS in a bad state.  You should
not use them on your personal computer.  Use in a vm or container.


Python 2.7 Notice
