Responsible for building the Windows binary package of the
game with cx_Freeze and Python 3.6

To build the package on Windows, run the following command on Windows:
    `python build_win32.py build`

"win32" is just the name used by cx_freeze and doesn't mean it is a 32-bit app.

DO NOT RUN FROM A VENV.  YOU WILL BE MET WITH INSURMOUNTABLE SORROW.
