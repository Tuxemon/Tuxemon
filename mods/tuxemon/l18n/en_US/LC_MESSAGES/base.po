"We started with confiscation, but most Tuxemon managed to escape. So we were forced to resort to extreme measures.\n"
"Our sister organization Spyder developed a drug that could change Tuxemon.\n"
"It isolated a portion of the brain that every Tuxemon mysteriously has and overloaded it.\n"
"Once the Gage Paludal Lamina was overloaded with electricity, their will to resist faded and they became docile.\n"
"Because of some unexpected and tragic side effects, sadly, a few species are now effectively extinct,\n"
"Rockitten, Fruitera, and Hydrone specifically.\n"
"Now, outside of a few stragglers in the wild, this generation only interacts with Tuxemon when they work for us.\n"
"The birthrate is at an all time high, and approval of the Omnichannel has not fallen since the year before the restrictions.\n"
"Wild Tuxemon were a pervasive curse, threatening to destroying humanity. Omnichannel has fixed that and imposed order.\n"

"Well... Heh. We own the media, so I guess it wouldn't matter, but I wanted to share it all the same.\n"
"After consulting with my advisors, we have decided that the best way to become more comfortable with Tuxemon, is to use them.\n"
"Now, it will be some time before we can integrate them into the workforce, but in the meantime, as I said before, we will be releasing them into the wild.\n"
"I realize this is a shock for everyone, plus I understand that some of you may even be afraid. We all know what happened before...\n"
"This is not the time to be afraid though, as Omnichannel will be sponsoring the revival of the ancient tradition known as The Trial.\n"
"Now, for you who are less versed in Fondent region history, a hundred years ago there was a tradition where young men and women would catch and raise Tuxemon.\n"
"They would then use these Tuxemon to battle others and ascend rank in their town, with the best Tuxemon Trainer gaining status and power.\n"
"We will be creating a version of this for the modern day. We will be forming battle areas in multiple cities across Fondent.\n"
"Each Battle Area will need to be completed in order and the most promising trainer, or trainers, will be able to attempt the Championship.\n"
"The Championship will be held on top of the Omnichannel Tower in Cotton Town, but only once a Tuxemon Trainer has made it through every Battle Area.\n"
"The Trial is designed as a way to slowly introduce public life to Tuxemon and to encourage travel throughout the region.\n"
"Who better to demonstrate this than our youth?\n"
"Each Match will be broadcast live on Omnichannel-T, the newest television station devoted exclusively to Tuxemon-related programming!\n"
"Don't worry, the addition will be reflected in your bill.\n"
"Oh, and one more thing, all Tuxemon Trainers will be exempt from the curfew.\n"
"Before this of course, you will need a Tuxemon! Now, not everyone can be allowed to become a Tuxemon Trainer. That would be pure chaos!\n"
"First, you'll have to register your name with your local Omnichannel representative and if you're selected, you'll be sent to Omnichannel training.\n"
"After successful completion of your training, you will be provided with a Tuxemon and can start participating in The Trial!\n"
