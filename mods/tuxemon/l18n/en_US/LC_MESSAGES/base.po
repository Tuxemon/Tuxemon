"So people decided to use Tuxemon as messengers and to settle disputes. \n"
"About ten years ago, the crackdown on Tuxemon was initiated.\n"
"Now, only approved persons can own and raise Tuxemon. \n"
"My group uses Tuxemon for research, that's why we all have them. \n"
"You are unusual, you are not approved by Omnichannel. \n"
"You might be the trainer we have been waiting for.\n"
"Omnichannel, as ruthless as they are, are not the only threat we have here. \n"
"There is another organization called Spyder.\n"
"You shouldn't have to worry too much about them, they aren't too active around here. \n"
"Now, we'll send you back on your journey. \n"

"Aeble: I'm the CEO here at the Omnichannel, every broadcast you see, gets approved by me.\n"
"Now, I'm not the only one that does their part. Omnichannel has a board that helps administrate the various districts.\n"
"And what do you know...the board keeps getting reelected every year!\n"
"Omnichannel's goal is to open up the world to all. The only way to do that though, to make everyone equal,\n"
"Was to restrict Tuxemon.\n"
"We started with confiscation, but most Tuxemon managed to escape. So we were forced to resort to extreme measures.\n"
"Our sister organization Spyder developed a drug that could change Tuxemon.\n"
"It isolated a portion of the brain that every Tuxemon mysteriously has and overloaded it.\n"
"Once the Gage Paludal Lamina was overloaded with electricity, their will to resist faded and they became docile.\n"
"Because of some unexpected and tragic side effects, sadly, a few species are now effectively extinct,\n"
"Rockitten, Fruitera, and Hydrone specifically.\n"
"Now, outside of a few stragglers in the wild, this generation only interacts with Tuxemon when they work for us.\n"
"The birthrate is at an all time high, and approval of the Omnichannel has not fallen since the year before the restrictions.\n"
"Wild Tuxemon were a pervasive curse, threatening to destroying humanity. Omnichannel has fixed that and imposed order.\n"
"Unchecked, Tuxemon are a force of destruction and anyone who says otherwise is lying. Sorry, I must head to work.\n"

"After consulting with my advisors, we have decided that the best way to become more comfortable with Tuxemon, is to use them.\n"
"Now, it will be some time before we can integrate them into the workforce, but in the meantime, as I said before, we will be releasing them into the wild.\n"
"I realize this is a shock for everyone, plus I understand that some of you may even be afraid. We all know what happened before...\n"
"This is not the time to be afraid though, as Omnichannel will be sponsoring the revival of the ancient tradition known as The Trial!\n"
"Now, for you who are less versed in Fondent region history, a hundred years ago there was a tradition where young men and women would catch and raise Tuxemon.\n"
"They would then use these Tuxemon to battle others and ascend rank in their town, with the best Tuxemon Trainers gaining status and power.\n"
"We will be creating a version of this for the modern day. We will be forming battle areas in multiple cities across Fondent.\n"
"Each Battle Area will need to be completed in order and the most promising trainer, or trainers, will be able to attempt the Championship.\n"
"The Championship will be held on top of Omnichannel Tower in Cotton Town, but only once a Tuxemon Trainer has made it through every Battle Area.\n"
"The Trial is designed as a way to slowly introduce public life to Tuxemon and to encourage travel throughout the region.\n"
"Who better to demonstrate this than our youth?\n"
"Each Match will be broadcast live on Omnichannel-T, the newest television station devoted exclusively to Tuxemon-related programming!\n"
"Don't worry, the addition will be reflected in your bill.\n"

msgid "spyder_dojo_fu2"
msgstr "Throughout their lives, most monsters pass through different stages.\n For example, a Rockitten may become a Rockat and then a Jemuar. This is called Morphing.\n Most Morphing occurs because a monster reaches a certain level,\n but there are other ways that Morphing can occur,\n like Dollfin becoming Bigfin when exposed to Sweet Sand."
msgid "spyder_dojo_yin2"
msgstr "Monsters have six Stats: HP, Melee, Ranged, Armor, Dodge and Speed.\n HP determines how much Damage they can take from attacks before passing out.\n Melee determines how much Damage their melee and touch attacks do.\n Ranged determines how much Damage their ranged and reach attacks do.\n Armor reduces Damage from melee and reach attacks.\n Dodge reduces Damage from ranged and touch attacks.\n Whichever monster has the higher Speed acts first in battle."
msgid "spyder_dojo_zhu2"
msgstr "Every monster has two Tastes: Warm and Cold.\n A Warm Taste makes the monster 10 percent better in one Stat:\n Speed for Peppy Taste, Melee for Salty Taste, Armor for Hearty Taste,\n Ranged for Zesty Taste and Dodge for Refined Taste.\n A Cold Taste makes the monster 10 percent worse in one Stat:\n Speed for Mild Taste, Melee for Sweet Taste,\n Armor for Soft Taste, Ranged for Flakey Taste and Dodge for Dry Taste."
msgid "spyder_dojo_xiang2"
msgstr "In combat, monsters can choose from up to four techniques that they know.\n Techniques have an accuracy, which determines how likely they are to occur.\n If a technique has a Power, that determines how much Damage it does.\n Some techniques impose a condition on the user or the target,\n or both - and the technique's Potency determines how likely that is to occur.\n Some techniques, once used, take a while to become available again."

msgid "spyder_dojo_wan2"
msgstr "Every monster is composed of one or two elements, \n and every move that they can perform is composed of one or two elements. \n A monster's element determines which moves it resists, and which moves it is weak against. \n It takes half damage from moves of the element it is resistant to, \n and double from moves of the element it is weak against."

msgid "spyder_dojo_kataro1"

msgid "spyder_dojo_iroh1"
