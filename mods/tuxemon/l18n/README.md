Localization
===========

All translations are generated using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tuxemon/).
Changes can be made directly in the PO files located in the individual locale subdirectories
or generated online using the Weblate service. When adding new msg_ids, it is sufficient to
add them to the en_US locale as weblate can generate the rest. For complete guidelines refer
to [CONTRIBUTING](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) doc.
