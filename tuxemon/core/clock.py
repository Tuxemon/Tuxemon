        Limitations
        ===========

        There is a hard limit of 10 items that can be scheduled on
        next tick.  This limit reduces the power and performance
        impact of the clock on mobile and battery operated computers.

        A runtime error will be raised if the maximum is reached.


        Unscheduling
        ============

        If callback returns False (not None), then it will not be
        scheduled again.


        Soft Scheduling
        ===============

        This is useful for functions that need to be called regularly,
        but not relative to the initial start time.
        for example: events which need to occur regularly -- if all audio
        updates are scheduled at the same time
        (for example, mixing several tracks of a music score, or playing
        multiple videos back simultaneously), the resulting load on the
        CPU is excessive for those intervals but idle outside.  Using
        the soft interval scheduling, the load is more evenly distributed.
